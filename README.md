# -Random-Forest-Model
cancer.csv is the data that I work on and AI.ipynb is the model that I made:
I build a model that can predict whether a person will have a cancer or not
How i do in this project?
-drop the missing values.
-prepare time series data for analysis
-Create my feature matrix and target vector ,Divide my data
-build a Random Forest model for classification.
-build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
-Evaluate the model using classification
-Load and save files using python Address imbalnced data using resampling techniques
