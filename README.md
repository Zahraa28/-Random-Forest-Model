# -Random-Forest-Model
"I developed a machine learning solution using a Random Forest model to predict whether a person has cancer based on their medical data. Using Python and libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib, I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, trained the model, and evaluated its performance. The model achieved an accuracy of 95%, showcasing its reliability in predicting cancer outcomes. This project demonstrates my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems and can be adapted to other industries like healthcare and finance for predictive modeling.
